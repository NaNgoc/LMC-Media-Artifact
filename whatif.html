                        <h2 class="section-heading">1. What if sharing becomes so algorithmic, this rapid dissemination of information leads to cultural exchange so immense that it ignites the erosion of cultural identities?</h2>
                        <p>As digital media evolves, the spread of information accelerates and the world becomes increasingly interconnected. Most online platforms work to optimize users’ content algorithmically, deliberately displaying pictures and videos that relate to users’ interests and behaviors. These platforms are becoming more and more designed to specifically tailor to users’ preferences, ultimately encouraging us to spend more time engaging with others online. More time on platforms where people present themselves, their lives, and their individual culture results in immensely deep connections and heightened cultural exchange. However, such exponential exchange raises a critical concern: is this digital revolution eroding individuals’ culture?</p>
                        <p>In the most extreme futuristic case, widely sharing cultural narratives could result in a homogenized universal culture where individuals’ uniqueness is so spread and integrated within others’ that it is ultimately diminished. According to Harold Innis, the dissemination of widespread information via space-biased media is prone to rapidly alter the culture(s) of society. Mustafa Nasser’s “Eroding Cultural Traditions: Understanding its Impact on Social Heritage” examines how digital media’s provision of increasing interconnectedness leads to a convergence of cultures. The author dives into how this “phenomenon of cultural hybridization” can harmfully outshine particular cultural aspects or blur the lines of authentic tradition. He writes, “Traditional rituals incorporate modern elements. While this fusion can be celebrated, it also raises questions about preserving cultural heritage in its unadulterated form.” Algorithms may grow to offer an expansive variety of cultural perspectives to users, which is evidently bound to compromise the essence of human variety. Simultaneously, because algorithms are curated towards user preferences, this also raises a linguistic concern. Nasser explains that digital media algorithms are working to prioritize well-known languages, especially English, which sidelines others. This scarcity in languages, which often serve as a cultural staple, that are simply lesser-known can “slowly erase linguistic legacy.”</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">2. What if society becomes tremendously more empathetic?</h2>
                        <p>The innovation of digital media most commonly involves transcending the traditional bounds of communication, particularly basic text or audio. Digital media is likely to include a substantially increased amount of visual elements. Media platforms today are on track to emphasize visual content, including images and videos, infographics, and animations. The Visua article “Growth of Visual Media in Social Media, ECommerce, and Messaging” cites that “much of our digital world is now largely composed of visual media…social media platforms have swiftly evolved from largely text-based beginnings to being increasingly reliant on visual media.” Through these ever-prevalent visuals, individuals are clearly more engaged in the media that they are consuming. This aligns with Scott McCloud’s theory that visual mediums of communication are uniquely appealing to a broad audience because they establish a strong, empathetic bond between content creators and their viewers.</p>
                        <p>With younger generations, media use and empathy are directly linked, as according to a 2023 University of Wisconsin-Green Bay study. This is promising for a more empathetic society in coming years. Enhanced empathy via digital media could foster a greater embrace of individuals and their differences, prompting a significant sense of connection and community. It could revolutionize education of social issues, and thus, revolutionize society in eliminating systemic injustices. In addition, society becoming considerably empathetic would fuel the cycle of sharing, as this emotion enables people to share their personal experiences and develop deep connections with others.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">3. What if AI becomes so prevalent in digital media platforms that they completely reconstruct our knowledge of historical events?</h2>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence is designed to extract vast amounts of information and data. It is actively becoming more integrated across various emerging platforms; its presence is surging immensely. These systems possess advanced learning where users can simply write a prompt to let technology take the wheel in generating certain graphics, texts, or data itself. This increased prevalence and consequent reliance on AI is bound to be harmful, especially towards people’s knowledge of history.</p>
                        <p>Theorist EH Carr stated that people’s perception of history falls into the hands of the teller. What happens when the teller is prone to a variety of technologically-based errors?</p>
                        <p>With AI, information is gathered from many different sources by many different providers; thus, there is a risk to consider, which is that some writers may be putting out perspectives of historical events with false or inaccurate information. AI’s increased presence in generative platforms can lead to widespread misinformation, and a misinterpretation of history. In fact, people are already using new AI technologies to create fake representations of events. In a Vice article titled “People Are Creating Records of Fake Historical Events Using AI,” author Jordan Rhone writes that AI innovation is occurring at a speed that is difficult to keep up with. As a result, “maintaining and creating adequate safeguards will be challenging; people will still fall for images, especially as they are shared without context.”</p>
                        <p>Aside from creating and spreading flat-out false information, AI can also alter history by reshaping historical perspectives due to its inherent lack of personal touch. A Finextra article, “The Psychological Toll of AI: Erosion of Empathy and Trust in Our Relationships” notices that “the increasing integration of AI into our daily lives has the potential to erode empathy and undermine our social fabric. AI systems are incapable of experiencing emotions or understanding human experiences as humans do…people [can] become desensitized to violence, hate speech, and other harmful content.” When the teller of history lacks empathy or contextual understanding, the severity of a given event’s impact can get watered down. AI can present historical retellings that lack crucial information, oversimplify complex events, or enforce historical misconceptions. They may trivialize sensitive or traumatic perspectives from people involved or affected by historical events, severely influencing our perceptions of history.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the evolution of digital media may foster a widely misinformed and unempathetic society.</p>
